When the Tesla is plugged in the charger and home, this app can handle the charging.

You can create flows with the following actions:

- Set charge mode (Off, Automatic, Manual, Charge now)
- Set period for charging
- Control charging (start, stop, charge limits)
- Control aircondition
- Lock / unlock doors, trunk and frunk
- Control Sentry mode
- Add and delete geofences
- Set 'Data fetch interval' (polling frequency)
- Reset power meter

It has triggers for charging and geofences, and conditions for checking if the car is plugged in the charger, is moving or at a specific geofence location.

Use the Automatic mode for charging with lowest utility prices in the charge period.
